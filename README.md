## Steps

## Task 1: Use a template to provision an infrastructure

In this task, I will deploy a virtual machine that will be used to test monitoring scenarios.

1.	Download the \Allfiles\Lab11\az104-11-vm-template.json lab files to your computer.
2.	Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com.
3.	From the Azure portal, search for and select Deploy a custom template.

4.	On the custom deployment page, select Build you own template in the editor.
5.	On the edit template page, select Load file.
6.	Locate and select the \Allfiles\Labs11\az104-11-vm-template.json file and select Open.
